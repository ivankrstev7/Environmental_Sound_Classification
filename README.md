## Overview
Welcome to our "Human Data Analytics" project repository! Here, we've gathered our code and insights from exploring environmental sound classification using the ESC10 and ESC50 datasets. In our quest for accurate classification, we've employed a mix of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures and vision transformers. To enhance our models, we've implemented creative data augmentation techniques. Additionally, we've ventured into classical Machine Learning models, incorporating Feature Engineering to establish solid baseline models.
