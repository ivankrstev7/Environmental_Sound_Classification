Here you can find the codes for:
- the Piczak model remake in tensorflow
- the sequential CNN.

The model architecture of the Piczak model is in "utils/utils.py", the model architecture of the sequential CNN is in "seqCNN_2_train.py". Architecture and part of the code for the sequential CNN were originally taken and modified from https://github.com/DrStef/Deep-Learning-and-Digital-Signal-Processing-for-Environmental-Sound-Classification
